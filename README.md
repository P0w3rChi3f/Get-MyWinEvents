# Get-MyWinEvents  

Get-MyWinEvents tries to parse the data directly from https://github.com/P0w3rChi3f/CheatSheets/blob/master/WindowsEventIDs.md.  

## Get-DownloadWinEvents

Get-DownloadWinEvents can now download a text document of Windows event IDs and converts to a PSCustomObject.  
    Things left to do:  
    1. Create a function that can be called
    2. Paramiterize the URL  
    3. Create a test to switch between envronment variable `dirtmp` and `temp`
